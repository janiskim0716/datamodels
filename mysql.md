MySQL is an open-source database management system, and is a relational database. 
MySql can be reached here, https://www.mysql.com/ and uses a client-server model, meaning it has both a client component and a server component. 
In order to connect MySQL from Java, you need to use the JDBC driver from MySQL. Python also needs a MySQL driver to access the MySQL database.
